0a378bae-7833-11e1-b191-2d5f686e7ff4--None--Letters to the Editor --- While the front-page article on woman politicians asserted that the number of women running for office has plateaued, 2012 is poised to be historic in terms of women being elected. In fact, there are a record-breaking number of women running for Senate: six new challengers are Democratic women running strong campaigns, and the six Democratic female incumbents are in excellent shape for reelection. That means that despite Republican retirements, the Senate could have up to five new women at this time next year. And while the article was correct in stating that the number of women serving in the House of Representatives dropped after the 2010 elections, Democratic women have already reversed those losses by winning three out of five special elections in 2011. With the House field of female candidates growing every day, it is almost guaranteed that the number of women serving will increase after 2012. And these candidates have a tremendous wave of support behind them. Since the Republicans began pursuing their war on women, poll after poll show female voters rejecting their divisive social agenda and preferring candidates who put women and families first.
