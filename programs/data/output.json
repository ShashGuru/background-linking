She has woven a theme of women\u2019s empowerment throughout almost all of her\u00a0public remarks in the seven months since she stepped down as secretary of state. Clinton\u2019s advisers said that there is no political agenda behind her recent remarks and that she has made no decision to launch a campaign. They said the comments are simply a natural continuation of her lifelong focus on advocating for women. \u201cIf you look at her career from her early days in law school through today, there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s clear, which is this is an in\u00adcred\u00adibly important issue to her and has been over time,\u201d said Jennifer Klein, a longtime Clinton aide. In her political campaigns, Clinton has always tried to assert her toughness, to prove her mettle \u2014 first as the president\u2019s wife seeking a seat in the U.S. Senate and then as a would-be commander in chief in a time of war. In her 2008 campaign, she shunned the \u201cwoman\u201d label. Over and over, she said she was running because she thought she was the most qualified candidate and would make the best president. Now, coming off her four-year tour as the nation\u2019s top diplomat and free as a private citizen to pursue her own agenda, she is championing women \u2014 making speeches about the unfinished business of the women\u2019s movement and starting an international project focused on women and girls through the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s not at all surprising that, as she thinks about what she wants to do next, she\u2019s thinking about this issue,\u201d said Klein, who is helping her set up the project. Politically, said Nicolle Wallace, a former GOP strategist who has written two novels about a female Republican president, Clinton\u2019s embrace of women as trailblazers \u201chas the potential to be powerful and successful if it\u2019s authentic \u2014 and it has the power to backfire if it seems purely political.\u201d \u201cI have never done a book signing or a book event where women have not come up to me and said something about still being upset about what happened to Hillary \u2014 that sense that there was this unsettled experience,\u201d Wallace said. In the 2008 campaign, whether Clinton should make the historic aspect of her candidacy a part of her pitch to voters was a subject of considerable debate among her strategists. Their calculus was complicated by the fact that rival Barack Obama had embraced his role as an African American trailblazer. Ultimately, the advisers decided that doing so might alienate male voters, and they assumed that women would vote for her regardless. But that proved to be a miscalculation. When Clinton finished third in the Iowa caucuses, she lost among women by five percentage points to Obama. \u201cI think that was a big mistake on our part \u2014 not wholeheartedly embracing the idea of electing the first woman president of the United States,\u201d said one top Clinton adviser who spoke candidly about the 2008 strategy on the condition of anonymity. Clinton did not talk directly about her historic run until it was over. \u201cAlthough we weren\u2019t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it\u2019s got about 18 million cracks in it, and the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time,\u201d she said in her concession speech. As Clinton ponders a second run for president, white women \u2014 who made up 38 percent of the 2012 electorate \u2014 are one demographic group where she could improve upon Obama\u2019s finish. In every presidential election since the advent of national exit polling in 1972, no Democrat has won a majority of white women. Obama fared particularly poorly last year, losing white women to Republican Mitt Romney by 56 percent to 42 percent. The 2016 Democratic primary campaign probably won\u2019t get underway for at least another year, but the epochal nature of Clinton\u2019s potential candidacy is fueling buzz around her. \u201cI think the country is ready for Hillary,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told NBC News last month. Emily\u2019s List, a group that works to elect more women, is barely disguising its support for Clinton. It is staging town hall gatherings in early-voting states \u2014 the first was Friday in Iowa, with additional events planned for New Hampshire and Nevada \u2014 as part of its \u201cMadam President\u201d campaign. \u201cWe hope she runs, and we\u2019re looking forward to standing with her if she decides to do that, but we still live in a country that has never elected a woman to the White House,\u201d Emily\u2019s List President Stephanie Schriock said. \u201cThis is not an insignificant moment.\u201d On Monday in San Francisco, the American Bar Association will honor Clinton with the prestigious ABA Medal for her career as a pioneering woman. In 1987, Clinton, then the first lady of Arkansas and the first female partner at the venerable Rose Law Firm, chaired a new ABA commission on women in the legal profession. Aides said she plans to talk about that experience in her acceptance speech. \u201cGo back to a time when women were not a recognized face of the legal profession, and around that time came Hillary Clinton,\u201d ABA President Laurel G. Bellows said. \u201cShe is an advocate of the highest order.\u201d In 1995, Clinton made a global splash when, as first lady of the United States, she declared in Beijing, \u201cHuman rights are women\u2019s rights, and women\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d As secretary of state, she made women\u2019s empowerment a core focus. She gave major speeches about the power that women can have in improving government, expanding an economy and securing peace. Clinton devoted her first public remarks after leaving the State Department, an address at the Vital Voices Global Partnership gala, to a discussion of the \u201cuntapped potential\u201d of women. And she continued that theme at the Women in the World conference in April. Women, she said, \u201care agents of change, we are drivers of progress, we are makers of peace \u2014 all we need is a fighting chance.\u201d A couple of months later, at a Clinton Global Initiative event in Chicago, she said, \u201cWhen women participate in politics, the effects ripple out across society.\u201d Conference attendees responded with knowing applause. \u201cShe talks about it very passionately now,\u201d said Mo Elleithee, a spokesman with Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign. \u201cI think she\u2019s aware of that unique role she can play in driving that message and is going to continue to do it.\u201d For the first time in Clinton\u2019s life under the public spotlight, she is unencumbered by other people\u2019s agendas, noted former congresswoman Ellen Tauscher, a Clinton friend and State Department adviser. \u201cIn all of those roles, Hillary Clinton supplicated her own personal passions and concerns, the things that she was troubled about \u2014 she put them all aside to do things for the people that she was representing,\u201d Tauscher said. \u201cNow this is the first time she actually gets to speak for herself.\u201d In June, Clinton spoke at Bryn Mawr, a historic women\u2019s college in Pennsylvania. She talked about her desire to see more female heads of state. \u201cBryn Mawr is Welsh for \u2018big hill,\u2019\u2009\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe still have a long way to go and a big hill to climb. If this was easy, it would have already been done. Let\u2019s keep our eye on the goal.\u201d"}, "_id": "02ae7136-006d-11e3-9711-3708310f6f4d", "_index": "trec_news"}, {"_score": 1.0, "_type": "news_articles", "_source": {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/tiger-populations-are-dwindling-due-to-poaching-and-habitat-destruction/2014/07/07/0325ff5c-fd4d-11e3-932c-0a55b81f48ce_story.html", "news_type": "Health & Science", "title": "Tiger populations are dwindling due to poaching and habitat destruction", "date": 1404768010000, "author": "Amy Mathews Amos", "paragraph": " Photojournalist Steve Winter spent a decade photographing tigers in the wild in Asia. In 2007, when his life partner, writer Sharon Guynup, joined him for an assignment in India\u2019s Kaziranga National Park, they both came away concerned about the fate of these great animals. A century ago, more than 100,000 tigers roamed across 24 Asian countries, from Turkey to Indonesia. Today, they have disappeared from most of their historic range, and poaching, deforestation and a huge Chinese market for tiger parts (which are used in traditional Chinese medicine and as luxury items) have reduced their numbers to no more than 3,200. \u201cWe realized that tigers are almost gone, and no one seems to recognize that,\u201d Guynup said. The couple have collaborated on a book, \u201cTigers Forever,\u201d that combines magnificent images of the wild animals with troubling text about their dwindling state. Guynup said they hope it will shock the world into doing something \u201cbefore the tigers are gone.\u201d The two recently spoke by telephone with The Post from their home in New Jersey on what it will take to save the world\u2019s biggest cat. Americans often assume that tigers are protected. How have conservation efforts failed? Guynup: Because big conservation organizations have such huge fundraising needs and large administrative costs, their message to the public is often \u201cWe\u2019re saving tigers, we\u2019re saving polar bears.\u201d I think that message has lulled the public into believing that we\u2019re actually making progress. The biggest downfall of every large conservation organization today is that they are not addressing the demand [for tiger parts]. Unless the demand from China is stopped, tigers won\u2019t survive very far into the future. The organizations that are addressing the demand are the Wildlife Protection Society of India, the Environmental Investigation Agency based in London and WildAid, based here in the United States. Those are smaller, investigative, nimble organizations, and they\u2019re on the ground doing the undercover investigative work showing what\u2019s happening. And the combination of legal tiger farms in China, where they can legally sell skins, and an ongoing trade in tiger bone for tiger bone wine [believed to cure arthritis and impart strength, among other things] is killing the wild tigers across their range. Are those sales to China the biggest threat to tigers? Guynup: Poaching has really skyrocketed, and it\u2019s fueled by the legal trade within China. There was a call by the international community in 2007 for all tiger-range countries to phase out tiger farming. But China\u2019s tiger farms have only grown. As long as those farms exist and there is a legal trade, they will not only stimulate demand but also launder all the wild products. China argues that they should be able to have tiger farms because it\u2019s a domestic issue. But it\u2019s not. That demand is killing India\u2019s tigers and Thailand\u2019s tigers and other countries\u2019 tigers. Winter: Stopping habitat loss is also very important. I saw that in Sumatra. When I first went to Sumatra [which is part of Indonesia] for a tiger story, we thought that [the Sumatran] tiger would be the next subspecies to go extinct. Now, that no longer seems to be the case [because their population appears to be higher than previously estimated]. But there also doesn\u2019t seem to be any movement toward protecting whatever land is left and stopping the rampant destruction of the forest for palm oil and wood. The fact that tiger numbers are now understood [to be higher than previously thought] in Sumatra is important. And value has been placed on their continued survival by some important people in Indonesia. For example, one of the country\u2019s most influential businessmen, Tomy Winata, has [become interested]. He founded a tiger sanctuary in 1996, which is part of a national park. With effective enforcement and zero tolerance toward poaching, he and his team have successfully secured a significant area. And Thailand also created [an enforcement project] at the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in 2005 on the Thai-Burma border that has a protection force that is now being mirrored in other South Asia protected areas. But tigers don\u2019t exist in viable breeding populations elsewhere except in a few limited locations in India, Sumatra and Siberia. Guynup: That patrol in Huai Kha Khaeng is a military-style patrol that does a pretty good job of protection [against poachers]. National parks that have tigers living within them need protection the same way cities need police. More than half of the world\u2019s remaining wild tigers live in India. The Bengal tigers in India are the biggest hope for tiger survival. But it\u2019s a country that is trying to keep an economy cranking at a high level, and there are 1.2 billion people living in India, so there\u2019s a fight over resources and land. India is a poaching target because it shares a long, porous border with China. India is where the most tigers are, so that\u2019s the source [for many poachers]. Your book chronicles both the thrills and perils of tracking tigers throughout Asia, including dodging a charging rhino and patrolling for poachers with rangers. What was the biggest challenge you faced? Winter: I think that always the biggest challenge is showing readers something they haven\u2019t seen before and creating renewed interest. You would never see a tiger in Sumatra or Thailand without using remote cameras [that trigger photographs when animals walk by], and because of the way I use remote cameras with artificial lights that balance with the daylight, I sometimes get pictures that people think look fake. Or they just stop when they see them. Which is great, because even if someone says, \u201cWow, that looks unreal,\u201d they\u2019ve just spent five seconds longer on that picture than they normally would. Because people are inundated with images 24/7, my job is to find a different way to photograph tigers, not just from the top of an elephant or in a jeep, but eye to eye with these intimate portraits that I\u2019m able to get through the camera traps. But it\u2019s very dangerous because you\u2019re on the ground. In Kaziranga, I was filled with tension every time I exited the jeep to check the traps, because there are other animals like rhinos and elephants around, and you\u2019re entering their territory on your feet. And then you faced some challenges when you came home. Hurricane Sandy hit just as you began pulling this book together, and you were forced to evacuate your house. Guynup: It affected me more than Steve because I was starting to research and write the book on a very, very short deadline. I did my first overnight Skype interviews to Asia from a Super 8 motel where we stayed for about 10 days with our 90-pound Lab, our four-month-old puppy, the cat, my adult son and Steve and I, so that was a little crazy. Steve lost 20 years of field gear, and we lost lots of personal stuff. Our home wasn\u2019t ruined, but we had huge storage in the basement that included prints and original slides. The book includes spectacular photographs of wild tigers, but it also includes disturbing images of poachers, traps and other animals. Why? Winter: I\u2019ve found two ways to overcome information overload. Number One is showing people images they haven\u2019t seen before and Number Two is showing images that might be a bit disturbing. So they look at them and hopefully they will find out the story behind the photograph. I also looked at Kaziranga as a kind of historic landscape where tigers live with species as in centuries past. This is what it used to look like and still does in a few select locations. It\u2019s great to see intact ecosystems that are protected with a variety of animals that are in them. Guynup: Steve began his career as a photojournalist. So when he photographs wildlife, he approaches his assignments as a photojournalist. Unless you\u2019re going to tell the whole story and show people why these animals are disappearing and get them to care and hopefully to act, all the pretty pictures in the world aren\u2019t going to save these animals. What else should be done to help save tigers? Guynup: The international community needs to join together and pressure China to stop the sale of tiger parts, skins, bones, all tiger parts from all sources, both captive and wild. And tiger-range countries need to use tools that are available through Interpol and other international agreements, to step up enforcement. If the demand is stopped, if the tiger farms are phased out and enforcement steps up, we can save tigers. But if that doesn\u2019t happen, they\u2019re going to disappear, possibly within our lifetime. People might think, \u201cOh, farms: Well, that kind of takes care of it all, and then we\u2019ll put them back.\u201d But once tigers have been in captivity and in contact with people, they\u2019re too dangerous to put back into the wild. There are heavy population pressures in Asia, but India has over 40 tiger reserves. There\u2019s plenty of land. And now many areas are working to set up corridors to connect these reserves, so that the populations don\u2019t become inbred. As long as tigers have habitat, food and protection, they\u2019re a very resilient species. They bounce back. There is hope.

In New York, counterterrorism\u00a0resources\u00a0were deployed to transit hotspots\u00a0across the city. The New York Police Department said teams were sent to crowded areas and transit stops \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d \u201cAt this time, there is no known indication that the attack has any nexus to New York City.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson said in a statement that \u201cadditional security\u201d would be deployed at major city airports and rail and transit stations across the country. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) directed state officials to step\u00a0up patrols\u00a0at heavily traveled locations around the state, including bridges, tunnels, airports and mass transit systems, he said. \u201cPublic safety is paramount, and I want the people of this state to know that we are working with all local and federal partners, remaining vigilant and taking all necessary measures to keep New Yorkers safe,\u201d he said in a statement. At JFK International Airport, New York National Guard forces were providing additional security detail. The Guard deployed 400 service members across the New York City area Tuesday, Cuomo said. They focused increased patrols on transportation hubs such as JFK and LaGuardia Airports. In addition, New York State Troopers were monitoring Penn Station and Grand Central Station as well as\u00a0the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and George Washington Bridge. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey stepped up its police presence at airports, bridges, tunnels and the World Trade Center complex, Cuomo said. And the Metropolitan Transit Auhtority was upping patrols across the system. In Washington, Metro Transit Police advised passengers to remain vigilant. The agency said it would conduct additional K9 sweeps and patrols across the system Tuesday morning as a precaution, but that no \u201cknown, specific or credible threat\u201d existed.\u00a0Alexandria Deputy Police Chief\u00a0Shahram Fard said in a Tweet that\u00a0Alexandria Police\u00a0patrol officers were assisting Metro Transit Police in monitoring Metro parking lots, and it was expected that agencies across the region would aid\u00a0in the security effort. Internationally, the attacks led to the cancellation of\u00a0hundreds of flights \u2014 mostly in and out of Brussels Airport \u2014 which closed Tuesday. Brussels Airlines had cancelled 203 flights by Tuesday afternoon, according to the Flight tracking website\u00a0flightaware.com. On U.S. airlines, the site said,\u00a0flights with Brussels on their itinerary\u00a0were canceled. They included: A United Airlines flight bound for Dulles International Airport that was scheduled to\u00a0leave Brussels at 7:10 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, along with\u00a0three other United flights; six Delta Airlines flights and two American Airlines flights \u2014 one bound for Philadelphia and another departing from there for the Belgian capital. American Airlines spokesman Kent Powell said the airline has made accommodations for passengers with reservations to Brussels, and arrangements would be made for those who remain in Belgium. Flights to and from Brussels were canceled through Thursday, he said. American\u2019s next\u00a0flight to Brussels is\u00a0scheduled to depart\u00a0Philadelphia on Friday evening, while its next flight from Brussels back to the U.S. is\u00a0scheduled to leave the Belgian capital at 9:40 Saturday morning. \u201cAmerican Airlines is taking care of our employees and customers in Brussels after this morning\u2019s events. At this time, there are no reported injuries to our employees. American Airlines check-in operates at Row 8 of the departure hall, and the explosions did not occur at Row 8,\u201d Powell\u00a0said. \u201cAmerican Airlines flight 751 from Brussels to Philadelphia has been canceled for today. When operations at the Brussels airport resume, we will reaccommodate our customers.\u00a0We have issued a travel policy for customers with reservations to Brussels who wish to change their itineraries.\u201d The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority did not outline specific steps that were being taken at the region\u2019s two major airports, Dulles International and Reagan National airports, but a statement reinforced the airports\u2019 commitment to passenger safety. The statement encouraged passengers to stay vigilant and report any unusual activity. \u201cReagan National and Dulles International airports have a robust security structure, both publicly visible and behind the scenes,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe constantly train our employees and evaluate our security procedures, in collaboration with our federal partners and local mutual aid partners, to make adjustments, updates and enhancements based on new information and situations.\u201d Officials at Baltimore Washington International Airport said they were\u00a0\u201cworking closely\u201d with federal and state law enforcement agencies after the Brussels attacks, but that no specific threat existed. Maryland officials said Tuesday that travelers should expect to\u00a0see more police and canine explosive detection patrols throughout the state\u2019s\u00a0transportation network. In Chicago,\u00a0extra officers and canine units were\u00a0dispatched to the airports and Chicago Transit Authority\u00a0stations stations\u00a0as a precaution, the Chicago Tribune reported. A police spokesman told the paper that the interim police superintendent\u00a0has ordered \u201cstepped-up presence at airports and transportation sites within Chicago.\u201d In Los Angeles, the county sheriff\u2019s transit police swept Union Station, the downtown train station, and heightened security at other transit hubs, according to the Los Angeles Times. Security would be increased at several of the city\u2019s major metro stations, a spokesman told the paper. At\u00a0Los Angeles International Airport, officers would be making\u00a0their presence known more than usual, an airport police officer told the paper. And in San Francisco, there would be an increased uniform police presence at \u201ckey locations\u201d across the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, said spokeswoman Alicia Trost.

The World Wildlife Fund says surveys\u00a0indicate that 3,890 tigers now\u00a0live in 13 countries across Asia, up from an estimated 3,200 in 2010, when the last wide-scale counts were carried out. Increases were particularly notable in Russia, Nepal, Bhutan and India, which is home to the world\u2019s largest wild tiger population. WWF attributed the rise to better surveys, which are carried out by tiger-range countries and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, as well as enhanced protection efforts in the six years since those\u00a0nations pledged to double the population by 2022. \u201cWe\u2019ve watched tigers decline for decades and have dreamed of bending that curve in the other direction,\u201d said Carter Roberts, president and CEO of World Wildlife Fund (WWF). \u201cThis is a big deal.\u201d There are some caveats, of course. The current\u00a0tiger population is bigger than it was six years ago, but it\u2019s miniscule compared to the 100,000 believed to have lived in Asia in 1900, and it\u2019s still smaller than the estimated 5,000 to 10,000 captive tigers that call the United States home. Surveys remain poor in some countries, such as Malaysia. Last week, Cambodia announced that tigers were now extinct within its borders. And tigers are still prized, and killed, for the supposed medicinal value of their body parts. \u201cEvery part of the tiger \u2014 from whisker to tail \u2014 is traded in illegal wildlife markets, feeding a multibillion-dollar criminal network,\u201d WWF said in a statement.

If she wins, she will join Theresa May of Britain and Angela Merkel of Germany in the ranks of women who lead prominent Western democracies. They're not alone, either. In recent years, the number of women holding positions in both parliament and executive government\u00a0has grown.\u00a0As of June 2016,\u00a0women\u2019s membership in parliament doubled from 11.3 percent in 1995 to 22.1 percent in 2015, according to a recent study by the Inter-Parliamentary Union. And this\u00a0year alone, there have been\u00a0many historic firsts. In Iran, women won 17 seats during the Islamic Republic\u2019s parliamentary elections in February. \u201cThis is a record and we are happy that our dear women are taking part in all stages, especially in politics,\u201d Iranian President\u00a0Hassan Rouhani said in a speech\u00a0back in May. Africa has had some of the most dramatic breakthroughs over the past 20 years. As of June, four African nations were part of the top 10 as far as the number of women represented in parliament. Rwanda, for example, tops the chart as the country with the highest number of women represented in parliament in both the lower (63.8 percent) and upper houses (38.5 percent) in 2016. But women remain a relatively small group in parliaments around the world, and progress is slow. Data from the IPU shows that in a vast majority of countries, men still dominate the political stage.\u00a0In\u00a0both the lower and upper houses combined, women around the world account for around 22 percent of seats held in parliament. \"Yes it is an improvement considering that it started at a low base,\" Executive Director of U.N. Women Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka said. \"But if we continue at this pace, it's going to take us too long. We need to fast-track the attainment of gender equality.\" The U.S. is one country that lags the global average of women in the national legislature. It ranks behind 95 countries, including low- and middle-income countries such as Ethiopia, El Salvador and Suriname. Other countries that outperform the United States include Iraq, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. One way that countries have been fast-tracking female participation in politics is through gender quotas, and the results have left many surprised.\u00a0Countries that that have relatively low socioeconomic development or have just emerged from conflict, such as Afghanistan, Tanzania and Ecuador, have shown tremendous improvement and have\u00a0higher levels of\u00a0female representation in parliaments. Jennifer Rosen, assistant professor of sociology at Pepperdine University, says\u00a0emerging democracies give leaders a unique opportunity for leaders to\u00a0enshrine gender quotas in their new constitutions, helping bypass cultural barriers\u00a0that would have otherwise stood in the way of women participating in politics for many years. Different electoral systems also influence women's participation in parliament. While scholars agree that proportional representation systems, which\u00a0allow people to vote for a party list rather than a particular candidate, have\u00a0a positive influence on female representation in government, some are divided as to whether it has a positive impact on all countries or only on Western democracies. One way for countries to shift their mentalities is to encourage people in executive leadership positions to set an example, Rosen said. Ngcuka, the U.N. women executive director, agrees and said men play an important role and that women shouldn't be the only ones trying to \"move the glass ceiling,\" noting how attitudes change when influential leaders such as\u00a0Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominated a cabinet in 2015 that was half-female. Political parties that are supposed to provide gender quotas need to ensure that they place women in winnable positions, IPU Secretary General Martin Chungong said. \"In many instances they are not walking the walk,\" he said. \"It's not enough to have quotas. We need to provide incentives for people who don't want to implement them.\" What's also clear is that having women in national legislatures can change the way a country is governed. Research\u00a0shows that when women participate in politics, the conversation gets steered toward issues that their male counterparts often fail to address,\u00a0such as family planning, education and\u00a0gender-based violence. \"We have seen that there are certain issues women are better able to articulate,\" Chungong said. \"Women tend to take leading roles not because it is a women's issue, but because it has to do with livelihood of society as a whole.\" \u00a0 More on WorldViews The world is getting better at paid maternity leave.

Its kindling: Illegal items made of rhinoceros horn that had been confiscated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The event \u2014 which destroyed\u00a0whole horns, ornaments and products advertised as medicinals, together worth $1 million on the black market \u2014 was meant to draw attention to\u00a0the scourge of rhino poaching, which is happening at such an intense rate\u00a0that experts say the animals could become extinct in 15 years. Just\u00a05,000 black rhinos and 20,000 white rhinos remain in the wild in Africa, where illegal hunters slaughter them for their horns. In a statement, Fish and Wildlife explained\u00a0the\u00a0demand for\u00a0rhino horn like this:\u00a0\u201cSupposed remedies, which range from cancer treatments to hangover cures, are driving unprecedented poaching. In addition, objects made of rhino horn have more recently become status symbols to display success and wealth.\u201d The statement relies on a\u00a0widely cited belief \u2014 that rhino horn is plundered mostly for its use in traditional Asian medicines. But that isn\u2019t correct, said\u00a0Yufang Gao, a doctoral student in anthropology at Yale University, at least not in his native China, a major rhino horn market. In China, as Gao and fellow researchers recently\u00a0reported in the journal Biological Conservation, the market is driven by interest in art and antiques purchased\u00a0not as status symbols but as investment pieces.\u00a0The difference might seem minor. But it reflects a disconnect that Gao said is rooted in cultural barriers and miscommunication \u2014 and could be an important obstacle\u00a0to ending the illegal trade and poaching. \u201cRight now, most of the conservation communication programs only focus on the medicinal value of rhino horn,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to consider the art and antique market as a separate trade, and target the people who buy rhino horn because of its collectible and investment value,\u201d as well as auction houses. Gao said it is\u00a0certainly true that many\u00a0Chinese believe rhino horns \u2014 which are made of keratin, like fingernails \u2014 have healing powers, though there is no scientific proof that they do. Rhinoceroses roamed ancient China, and their horns were used to treat fevers, heart disease and other woes. \u00a0Those beliefs haven\u2019t died, but the government has more closely regulated\u00a0the traditional medicine market since banning rhino horn trade in 1993, Gao said. In recent years, however, as the growing number of middle-class and affluent Chinese looked for ways to diversify their portfolios and hedge against inflation, the art and antiquities market blossomed \u2014 as did their sales of very pricey rhino horn products. They are viewed in China as \u201cexcellent\u201d investments with an intrinsic value rooted in the rarity of their material,\u00a0Gao\u2019s study said. But you wouldn\u2019t know that from reading Western newspapers, which is what Gao and his colleagues did. They compared 166 articles on the Chinese rhino horn market that were\u00a0published from 2000 to 2014 in American and British\u00a0sources \u2014 including The Washington Post \u2014 with 332 Chinese news articles from the same period. As shown in the chart below, 75 percent of the Chinese articles reported on rhino horn\u2019s investment value, and just 29 percent reported on its medicinal value. On the other hand, 84 percent of Western articles mentioned its medicinal value, and only 6 percent its investment value. Reports on robbery of\u00a0rhino horn pieces from museums\u00a0illustrate the discrepancy, Gao said. A 2011 Guardian article\u00a0on \u201can epidemic of UK rhino horn thefts,\u201d for example, attributed it to a demand for powdered rhino horn used in \u201ctraditional Chinese medicine.\u201d \u201cNo Chinese would grind the rhino horn antique,\u201d Gao said. \u201cThey preserve it, they put it in their house as a collectible, or give it as a gift to someone.\u201d Gao also examined rhino horn art sales at\u00a0Chinese auctions from 1995 to 2011. They grew\u00a0dramatically, from 26 in 2000 to nearly 2,700 in 2011, and they were expensive: One carved cup sold for close to\u00a0$428,000. As seen in this chart, rhino poaching in South Africa, which has the largest rhino population and biggest poaching problem, also rose during that time, though Gao cautioned that it\u2019s not clear whether one trend drove the other. The sales, however, plummeted in 2012, shortly after the Chinese government re-emphasized its ban on rhino horn trade. But rhino horn remains valuable, he said, and it\u2019s possible that the sales have simply moved to the black market or to Vietnam, another huge buyer. But Gao has news for buyers: In real terms, the price of auctioned items didn\u2019t increase over the period he studied. \u201cSo rhino horn is not actually a good investment economically or ecologically,\u201d he said. This isn\u2019t the first time Gao has identified a gap between Chinese and Western understanding\u00a0of a conservation problem. He\u2019s also studied the ivory trade, which he says is commonly misattributed by English-language reporters to purchases made by China\u2019s rising middle class, when the demand is\u00a0far broader than that. Here\u2019s the good news, Gao says: Tackling the problem of ivory and rhino horn sold as art or ornaments isn\u2019t insurmountable. Like current Chinese interest in rosewood or some teas as investments, those are fads, he said. Getting people to abandon belief in rhino horn\u2019s curative powers will be harder. \u201cIt\u2019s still very deeply rooted in the culture,\u201d he said. Gao said he\u2019s\u00a0dedicated to helping Chinese and Westerners \u2014 neither of whose information is wrong, just incomplete \u2014 understand each other for the sake of conservation. He referred to the parable of the blind men who touched an elephant: One felt the ear and believed it was a fan, one touched the tail and thought it was a rope, and so on. None got the whole idea. \u201cWhat I try to do is use my identity as a Chinese who is able to see the different kinds of opinions and perceptions, and bring all these things together and try to see a more comprehensive picture of the problem,\u201d he said, adding that he\u2019s helped Chinese journalists report on the issue in Africa and hosted African conservationists in China. \u201cI have been trying to bridge the gap.\u201d Read more: New Zealand vows to kill ever weasel, rat and feral cat on its soil\u00a0 Dogs are born with ears and tails.

Not so fast.", "date": 1497178815000, "author": "Mary Nugent; Diana Z. O'Brien", "paragraph": " \u00a0 A\u00a0record-breaking\u00a0number of women were elected to the British Parliament in\u00a0Thursday\u2019s\u00a0election, with many calling it a \u201chistoric\u201d moment. When legislators return to Westminster next week, there will be 208 women among their ranks, or 32\u00a0percent of Parliament. The majority of the parties are also led by women. In fact, Prime Minister Theresa May is now negotiating with another woman, Arlene Foster of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, to form a government. But is this election really a turning point for women in the United Kingdom? Despite the headlines, these results represent only an incremental change \u2014 a gain of just 12 more seats for women. And although women might be better represented in Parliament than in the U.S. Congress, the United Kingdom still lags behind most European and Latin American democracies.\u00a0Thursday\u2019s\u00a0election moved it from\u00a046 to 39 in the global rankings. Focusing on the headline number also obscures significant variation across parties and regions. The parties aren\u2019t alike As with the Democrats in the United States, women\u2019s representation is highest in the center-left Labour Party. Women hold 45\u00a0percent of Labour seats (119 of 262) compared with 21\u00a0percent of Conservative seats. In fact, the number of women parliamentarians in the Conservative Party actually decreased from 70 to 67 in this election. The difference between the parties is because of a strategy \u2014 \u201call-women shortlists\u201d \u2014 adopted by the Labour Party in 1994. Labour requires that half of all winnable seats be contested by female candidates. When it was partially implemented for the first time in 1997, women\u2019s numbers grew from 37 to 101. Since being fully implemented from 2005 onwards, women\u2019s representation has never fallen below 27\u00a0percent. Scotland is different, too There is also variation within the U.K. itself. Women\u2019s representation actually decreased\u00a0in Scotland. This is in large part because of the Conservative gains in the region: among the thirteen returning members of Parliament, only one is a woman. And this is despite the striking prominence of women in Scottish politics, where the leaders of the three major parties are all women, and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon appointed a\u00a0gender-balanced\u00a0Cabinet. The U.K. isn\u2019t close to gender parity The U.K. remains a long way from gender parity in Parliament. To get there, the Conservatives will have to increase the number of female candidates competing in winnable seats. They\u2019ve tried to bolster women\u2019s numbers before through \u201csoft\u201d measures \u2014 such as the\u00a0Women2Win\u00a0initiative co-founded by Theresa May to support and train Conservative women, and the gender balanced \u201cpriority list\u201d of prospective candidates that local parties were encouraged to select from (although it proved unpopular and was soon\u00a0abandoned). Despite acknowledging the need for more women in politics, the Conservative Party remains opposed to a strategy like all-women shortlists. Their resistance is not surprising. While there are right-leaning parties in Western Europe with voluntary quotas (including the German Christian Democrats and Austrian People\u2019s Party), no conservative party in the region has been willing to implement this strategy. Moreover, Britain, unlike more than\u00a075 countries\u00a0across the globe, has not adopted legislation that mandates the selection or election of female candidates for office. A growing number of European countries have done so, including France in 1999, Ireland in 2012 and Poland in 2011. What comes next?  One crucial issue on the agenda: women\u2019s reproductive rights. The governing coalition will likely include the Conservative Party and Northern Ireland\u2019s\u00a0Democratic Unionist Party, and the DUP has consistently campaigned to limit\u00a0abortion\u00a0rights. The DUP\u2019s former health minister, Jim Wells, has even argued against abortion in cases of\u00a0rape. Newly elected MP Owen Paterson confirmed in an\u00a0interview\u00a0yesterday that abortion restrictions might be up for debate. At the same time, May\u2019s position is\u00a0precarious, and many observers do not expect this fragile coalition to last long. If new elections are on the horizon, then we will soon see whether there will be further increases in women\u2019s representation \u2014 and if so, what that means for public policy.

The noise was the sound of\u00a0large teeth scraping against his skull, he\u00a0told Denver ABC-affiliate KMGH. A\u00a0black bear, the teen\u00a0realized, was trying to pull him out of his sleeping bag by his head. \u201cIt grabbed me like this and\u00a0pulled me, and then it bit the back of my head and dragged me,\u201d the teen, identified only by his first name, Dylan, told KMGH. \u201cWhen it was dragging me, that was the slowest part. It felt like it went forever.\u201d Fellow staffers and campers were roused by the commotion and tried to scare the bear away as Dylan fought back. The bear dragged Dylan about 10\u00a0feet, then dropped him and walked\u00a0away. Dylan was taken to the hospital. His injuries weren\u2019t life threatening. Authorities are searching for the bear, which\u00a0will likely be euthanized, according to the Associated Press. The teen is a counselor at Glacier View Ranch, a camp owned by the Rocky Mountain Conference of Seventh Day Adventists, the AP reported. According to the camp\u2019s website, the conference hosts seven weeks of summer camps for youth ages 7\u00a0to 18. The camps feature zip lines, go-carts and canoeing, \u201call in a safe, Christ-centered atmosphere.\u201d The ranch confirmed the attack on its website, and said it would not cancel the rest of the summer\u2019s camps. About 100 children and teens are expected to attend. Campers that Dylan was supervising over the weekend had asked if they could spend the night under the stars, sleeping by the camp\u2019s lake. Dylan relented. He told reporters he teaches wilderness survival at the camp. How fortuitous. One of the tips experts recommend for surviving a bear attack is to fight back. Dylan\u2019s experience follows other troubling reports of bear attacks, including two fatal maulings in Alaska a day apart last month. On June 18, Patrick \u201cJack\u201d Cooper, a 16-year-old from Anchorage, was killed by a bear after he veered off a trail during a mountain foot race south of the city, according to the AP. A day later, Erin Johns, a 27-year-old contract worker for Pogo Mine died in a mauling 275 miles northeast of Anchorage. Her 38-year-old co-worker was also injured. Authorities told the AP they were baffled by the uptick in bear attacks, although the numbers can fluctuate from year to year. Dylan\u00a0said his experience hasn\u2019t changed his attitude toward bears. In fact, he was back at camp \u2014 sporting fresh scars \u2014 when he talked to reporters. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the bears. I\u2019m not afraid of sleeping outside anymore.

It was another ranger, and she had a horrifying\u00a0message: A grizzly bear had mauled someone at the popular Granite Park guest chalet. Gildart called for help, setting in motion an urgent medical mission. Hours later,\u00a0as he slept in his apartment\u00a0at park headquarters, a colleague\u00a0knocked on his door. \u201cHe said: \u2018Bert, you\u2019ve got to get up. There\u2019s been a grizzly bear mauling,\u2019 \u201d recalled Gildart, now 77. \u201cI said, \u2018I know.\u2019 He said, \u2018No: There\u2019s been another one.\u2019 \u201d The information, Gildart says today, was \u201cmind-boggling,\u201d and for good reason. The park, nearly 1,600 square miles of stunning peaks and valleys in northwest Montana, had recorded\u00a0no grizzly-caused human fatalities since it was established in\u00a01910. Then, on one night, two bears in spots several miles apart killed two campers. Both victims were 19-year-old women. Those attacks, which took place 50 years ago this summer, set off an immediate quest at Glacier to understand how a tragedy of such infinitesimal odds could have happened. But they also marked a turning point in relations between North Americans and the continent\u2019s largest predators,\u00a0revolutionizing\u00a0how public agencies deal with bears and inspiring\u00a0new paths of research on grizzly behavior. The impact of the deaths still echoed in federal officials\u2019 recent decision to remove Yellowstone-area grizzlies from the endangered species list. \u201cWe\u2019ve certainly had our share of other types of fatalities, but none of them seemed to live like that particular event does,\u201d said John Waller, Glacier\u2019s bear biologist. \u201cIt was a watershed moment for bear management, not just in Glacier but the whole National Park Service. It fundamentally changed how we view our relationship with bears.\u201d Theories about the attacks\u2019 cause swirled in the aftermath. Perhaps\u00a0lightning and dry conditions, which sparked\u00a0wildfires that week, had possessed\u00a0one bear\u00a0to drag Julie Helgeson from the Granite Park campground where she slept and a second\u00a0to mangle Michele Koons at the Trout Lake site where she camped\u00a0with four friends. The women\u2019s menstrual cycles and the possibility that someone had given the bears LSD were also suggested triggers. But soon it became clear that\u00a0the problem was far more mundane: human food and garbage. Glacier, a park that had recorded just 110,000 visitors between 1910 and 1920, was in\u00a0the late 1960s welcoming nearly 1 million people a year, and more of them were heading into the backcountry. Granite Park Chalet, a mountaintop site reachable by trail, had so many visitors in 1967 that its incinerator could not contain all their trash, and managers discarded\u00a0the excess\u00a0in a gully behind the facility. Soon the\u00a0grizzly bears\u2019 nightly foraging there became\u00a0a tourist attraction. Many park staffers were uncomfortable with this situation, as recounted in Jack Olsen\u2019s 1969 book, \u201cNight of the Grizzlies.\u201d Among them were Gildart and his friend, wildlife biologist Dave Shea. They had witnessed five bears dine on trash at the chalet days before, and both had expressed concern\u00a0at park headquarters. \u201cIt was basically an incident waiting to happen,\u201d said Shea, 77, who worked at Glacier\u00a0for 36 years. In the Trout Lake area, meanwhile, one grizzly had\u00a0spent that hot summer rummaging through garbage barrels\u00a0near a collection of cabins, menacing hikers and raiding\u00a0backcountry campsites. Although backpacking was becoming more popular, there \u201cwas no wilderness ethic,\u201d\u00a0Waller said: Campers would simply leave behind their trash, providing nourishment to\u00a0bears smart enough to associate it with people. Despite reports about the bear\u2019s behavior, park officials took no action. It wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t know bears and human\u00a0food were a dangerous\u00a0mix, Waller said; enforcement\u00a0just wasn\u2019t a priority. Now we know that bear-caused injuries at national parks in the West were quite high at the time, but then, he said, \u201cit all got swept under the carpet.\u201d The Glacier maulings also inspired a generation of scientists. Stephen Herrero had just finished his PhD in animal behavior in 1967 when he heard the news \u2014 and couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. \u201cHere was an ideal and important topic to try to understand \u2014 what went on in the minds and bodies of bears,\u201d said Herrero, who became\u00a0a\u00a0leading authority on bear attacks and behavior at the University of Calgary. \u201cThe big problem with the bears at Glacier was too many of them had learned to tolerate people more and more, and ignore people more and more, and then finally go after people themselves,\u201d Herrero said. The immediate response, however, was to find bears in the areas of the attacks and kill them. Within two days, rangers had fatally shot three at the chalet. Shea was among those who fired at the third, a sow with two cubs and a ripped paw pad that would have been painful, possibly increasing its aggression. Investigators concluded that this bear\u00a0had likely killed Helgeson and seriously injured her boyfriend. Gildart was deployed to track down the Trout Lake bear. He shot it two days after the attacks \u2014 an emaciated female\u00a0that had glass from garbage embedded between its teeth and a mass of human hair in its stomach. Soon after, Gildart helped collect several giant burlap sacks of trash near the lake. News of the\u00a0maulings, splashed across newspapers nationwide, was a public relations crisis for the Interior Department. A few\u00a0critics called on authorities\u00a0to finish off the extirpation of grizzly bears that had begun as early settlers pushed West\u00a0and left them in only a few patches of the United States, including Glacier. \u201cSome people said, we ought to go in there and hunt them all out. And that first year, that\u2019s kind of the way I felt,\u201d Gildart said. But he changed his mind: \u201cWe learned all these bears being seen on a regular basis were conditioned to food \u2014 and had lost their fear of people.\u201d That understanding triggered major changes in Glacier and elsewhere. A strict \u201cpack in, pack out\u201d policy was established for backcountry sites, which were also given designated cooking areas that were separate from sleeping areas. Cables or hooks for hanging food out of bears\u2019 reach were put in place. Campers were required to reserve spots, which limited their numbers. In a controversial decision, Yellowstone National Park managers in 1968 abruptly closed several\u00a0dumps where bears had long been eating \u2014 a move\u00a0researchers (and brothers)\u00a0Frank and John Craighead warned would cause the bears to seek food in campgrounds or populated areas outside the park, leading to more conflicts and bear deaths. Many researchers say they were right: Within a few years, dozens of Yellowstone-area grizzlies\u00a0were killed or sent to zoos, contributing to a population\u00a0drop that led to their inclusion in 1975\u00a0on the endangered species list. This spring, federal officials said Yellowstone grizzlies had finally recovered enough to be delisted. Strategies for what to do about \u201cproblem bears\u201d \u2014 the kind that seek human food \u2014 have evolved. In the early 1980s, Glacier said it would shoot or move more of them. Later, trapping and relocating prevailed, until studies revealed that the animals usually returned to where they were caught. Now the preferred method is hazing, or using things like rubber bullets and\u00a0loud cracker shells, \u201cto teach that bear no,\u201d Waller said. But the big idea is conflict prevention, he said. These days, Glacier regularly closes trails so grizzlies can access berry patches or carcasses without running into people. And all those bear-proof garbage cans in national parks and elsewhere bears live? They\u2019re produced by an industry that grew out of the Glacier attacks, Herrero said. \u201cTremendous progress has been made to keep bears away from these attractants,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really been quite successful \u2014 not only saving people\u2019s lives, but also saving bears\u2019 lives.\u201d There are no guarantees, of course, but park officials stress that the threat from bears is very low. Grizzlies have killed eight people in Glacier since 1967, most recently in 1998, and most were\u00a0food-conditioned bears. Bears, both black and grizzly, have injured about 100 people in the park\u2019s history, usually following\u00a0a \u201csurprise encounter,\u201d\u00a0Waller said. In\u00a01980,\u00a0Gildart was assigned to\u00a0patrol Glacier\u2019s backcountry on horseback, making sure people and bears remained separated. He gave tickets to campers who left trash and posted warning signs when he spotted bear tracks or scat, and he often encountered bears. They did what bears that don\u2019t eat human food typically do. \u201cThey\u2019ve all run,\u201d he said. But neither he nor Shea go to Glacier anymore. It\u2019s too crowded. The park expects\u00a0to log 3 million visitors this year,\u00a0many of whom act like they\u2019re \u201cwalking in a zoo,\u201d said Shea, who fears\u00a0the potential for tragedy is rising. \u201cThe bears aren\u2019t quite as wild as they used to be, because they\u2019re hearing people and people noises all the time.\u201d The hordes inevitably mean that it is harder to keep bears and people apart, often because the people don\u2019t heed\u00a0park advice. Waller said rangers\u00a0regularly find piles of blueberries and cans of cat food while on patrol \u2014 signs of attempts to lure predators\u00a0that can weigh\u00a0700 pounds. \u201cIt astounds me to see grizzly bears along a trail and people approaching within 20 or 30 feet to get pictures,\u201d Waller said. \u201cReally, bears are very very good to us. They\u2019re very tolerant, because despite our best efforts, people do amazingly stupid things every year.\u201d Read more: Yellowstone grizzly bears to lose protections after 42 years on endangered species list You remember Cecil the lion.
