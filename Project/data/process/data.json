Still, police have high hopes for Sam, because when they do put him on a case, he\u2019s proving to be as relentless as, well, what he is: a bloodhound. Sam, a 16-month-old hound from Huntsville, Ala., joined the force Aug. 14 and already has helped lead police to two missing people, Chief Cathy L. Lanier said at a news conference Thursday to announce his arrival. Each week, five or six people \u2014 some elderly and suffering from dementia, some very young \u2014 are reported missing in the city, and it will be Sam\u2019s job to find them. Police are counting on him to track scents in busy neighborhoods. \u201cThey are singularly focused on scent, which is great for an urban environment,\u201d Lanier said. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of the detective of the canine world.\u201d Police deploy 41 other dogs to track suspects and search for weapons, explosives and drugs. They use a variety of breeds \u2014 including German shepherds and Labradors \u2014 but none has the same skill set as Sam, the department\u2019s first bloodhound. Sam is about two feet tall and 79 pounds with a light brown coat, drooping and drooling jowls, light eyes and a fantastic nose. In his first case Saturday, Sam followed the scent of a missing man for about three blocks. When he reached a bus stop, he had information to report to his handler, Sgt. Johnnie Walter. Sam jumped up and pawed at Walter\u2019s chest. \u201cI told the detective, \u2018From what he\u2019s showing me, the subject got on a bus,\u2019\u2009\u201d Walter recalled. \u201cSure enough, they found him the next day all the way across the city, where he had been riding the bus.\u201d On his second case, a missing man had a 12-hour head start on Sam. Still, the hound followed the man\u2019s scent for two miles to a recreation center. \u201cThe detective said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this \u2014 this is a favorite hangout of his,\u2019\u2009\u201d Walter recalled. Sam even led police to a bleacher seat where the missing man liked to watch basketball. The track continued for three-quarters of a mile and onto a path, where the man was found, police said. Officers will welcome having Sam at the ready. When Michael Kingsbury, a 7-year-old with autism, went missing in July, police enlisted the help of bloodhounds from Montgomery County police. The boy later was found dead in a car. Prince George\u2019s County police have three bloodhounds \u2014 Justice, Bella and Tayaut. Sam does have shortcomings, such as heavy drooling, loud howling and a reputation for a subpar IQ, Lanier acknowledges. \u201cThey are good smellers,\u201d she said, \u201cbut not extremely smart.\u201d Walter joked: \u201cI\u2019ve taught him to sit \u2014 that\u2019s about it.\u201d But he sniffs for his supper, and his nose is 8,000 times more powerful than a human\u2019s, Lanier said. That makes the math simple for Sam\u2019s $8,000 price tag. Ever since he was 8 weeks old, Sam has been training to work in urban environments, Lanier said. Bloodhounds can find a trail that is days or weeks old and can track for several miles.", "43f5e1fe-efe7-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd": " KATHMANDU, Nepal \u2014 For members of Fairfax County\u2019s disaster-response team \u2014 both two-legged and four-legged \u2014 the grim challenges of searching for trapped survivors of Nepal\u2019s massive earthquake this week have been familiar and fulfilling. For the humans, most of them firefighters with years of disaster experience, the operation has brought reminders of missions after major quakes in Haiti and Turkey as part of the U.S. government\u2019s Disaster Assistance Response Team. Among the similarities they describe are the swaths of flattened, poorly built houses; the intricate and painfully slow task of listening for faint sounds and extricating trapped survivors; and the instant bonds formed among strangers working frantically to save lives. \u201cWorking with people who have a common purpose to save life is a great equalizer,\u201d said Mike Davis, 45. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the politics of a war or conflict. You are working on a humanitarian rescue, so you have a common language.\u201d At their tent camp inside a former U.S. Embassy compound here Friday, Davis and another Fairfax team member, Kit Hessel, 47, described an indelible memory from the Haiti quake in 2010: a 24-hour operation to rescue a woman trapped in a university stairwell, which ultimately required cutting off her foot to save her life. \u201cWe had people hanging upside down to get to her,\u201d Davis recounted. \u201cShe had to have her leg amputated later, but she lived, and later she got in touch with us to thank us.\u201d Hessel, a fire battalion chief in Fairfax, described another difficult rescue after a quake in Turkey when a young boy came to tell them that another child was trapped under a collapsed building. That rescue took 16 hours, he said, and while the team worked, local women brought them trays of figs, apples and other refreshments. Professionally, Hessel said the work brought other satisfactions, such as using the crane-operating and welding skills he learned as a youth, and the specialized knowledge he acquired later about cement composition, air pockets and the tendency of rain to mask human scent. \u201cI learned a lot from my dad, who owned a rigging and millwright company,\u201d Hessel said. The team travels with heavy rigging equipment to lift concrete slabs and steel beams off trapped people but uses locally provided cranes and machinery. \u201cWe try to be as self-sufficient as possible so we won\u2019t be a burden,\u201d he added. \u201cWe bring our own tools, water, food, showers, tents \u2014 everything but fuel.\u201d The team also flew to Nepal with six highly trained sniffer dogs: three Labrador retrievers, a German shepherd and two Belgian Malinois. They have been specially taught to react to the scents of live people but to ignore other odors, including food, animals and human cadavers. Despite the urgent and dangerous nature of their work, the dogs are encouraged to regard it as a form of play and are unaware that they are being sent to explore crannies too small and high-risk for humans. Their reward is the praise and affection of their handlers, whom they live with full-time. During a visit Friday to the canine team\u2019s tent, each dog relaxed on a cot with his or her handler, enjoying belly rubs, rope pulls and other pastimes while waiting to be called for duty. The bonds between each dog and human were immediately evident. On one cot, Ron Sanders, 54, patted Pryse, 6, an energetic tan Labrador, who had shown off her agility and intelligence the previous day while exploring the ruins of a collapsed guesthouse after the Fairfax team helped Nepali police rescue a trapped teenage boy. \u201cThis is her first deployment,\u201d said Sanders, who worked with older dogs in Haiti as well as during Hurricane Katrina and other crises. \u201cShe loves what she does \u2014 they all do.\u201d Sanders said the dogs must learn to act independently because they cannot always see or hear commands from deep inside a collapsed site. On an adjacent cot, Chris Holmes, 39, rested with Cazo, 9, a black shepherd who was awarded a medal of valor last year from the D.C. government while searching a collapsed house and alerting Holmes that there was someone, unconscious but alive, trapped inside. Before that, they served twice together in Haiti. Across the tent, Elizabeth Chaney and her 6-year-old Malinois, Ventoux, were furiously wrestling over a pull toy. She described him as a fast, athletic dog who had been waiting for four years after finishing his training before finally being called up for his first international deployment last week. \u201cVentoux has been wanting this for a long time, and I\u2019m so proud of him,\u201d Chaney said. \u201cWe\u2019re all proud of them. They have to spend 18 hours in a crate to get here, but like all the assets on our team, they are always ready to go.\u201d Read more: Rescuers pull \u2018miracle\u2019 survivor from quake in Nepal\u2019s capital In Nepal\u2019s capital, plumes from pyres and pleas from quake survivors A \u2018boom,\u2019 a prayer and then terror as avalanche roared down Everest Today\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world", "13afe080-50ae-11e5-933e-7d06c647a395": " Two Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services K-9 dogs died from heat exhaustion last week when a vehicle\u2019s air conditioner failed at the Baltimore City Detention Center. A bloodhound, Kojack, and Dingo, a Dutch Shepherd, were taking part in operations Tuesday to transfer prisoners from the facility ordered closed by Gov. Larry Hogan. \u201cThe dogs were in a car where the air-conditioning system malfunctioned,\u201d said department spokesman Gerard Shields, adding that one dog died at the scene; the other died the next day. Both died from heat exhaustion, he said. The agency confirmed the deaths when The Baltimore Sun asked about the dogs. The department is investigating whether any policy or procedures were violated, Shields said. He did not know long the dogs had been in the car or how long the dogs had worked for the agency. \u201cThe handlers are very distraught,\u201d Shields said. \u201cThese dogs provide an incredible service to the department in making our facilities safer. They are part of our department family.\u201d Shields said the deaths didn\u2019t happen Thursday \u2014 the day Stephen T. Moyer, the state corrections secretary, led a tour with reporters of the now-closed facility. Hogan ordered the Men\u2019s Detention Center closed last month, and corrections officials moved the final detainees out last week. Kojack and Dingo were not the first dogs to die on duty this year. In April, a service dog died after a state vehicle caught fire on Interstate 68 in Allegany County en route to a Cumberland complex, the Associated Press reported. The dog had recently completed training for contraband detection and patrol.", "7ed6d4c6-df0c-11e5-846c-10191d1fc4ec": " A black Labrador dog that works in a K-9 law enforcement unit has gone missing in the Woodbridge area of Virginia. Police in Prince William County said on their Facebook page that Milo was last seen about 7:45 p.m. Sunday in the 14100 block of Rahill Court. The dog ran away from his handler, police said, as the official was \u201creturning home from work.\u201d It was not known which federal agency Milo works for, officials said. Milo is described as a friendly dog and is \u201ctrained to work in and around people.\u201d He is not aggressive, police said, and is rather shy. Milo may avoid contact at first, police said. He weighs about 50 pounds and has a small patch of white hair on his chest. He had on a choke collar with his service badge and a vaccination tag on it. He was also wearing a black nylon-strap harness that buckles across the top of his back, according to police. Anyone with information is asked to call 703-792-6500.", "56f0438ee0fb34c341ccf5af36de5175": " By all accounts, Wednesday's\u00a0encounter between French police and a group of suspected terrorists in the Paris suburbs was an incredibly violent one: 5,000 bullets fired, dozens of grenades thrown, bodies so damaged that at first authorities were unable to say how many people had been killed. So it's somewhat remarkable that there was only one fatality on the police side of the showdown: Diesel, a 7-year-old Belgian Malinois police dog who was sent into the apartment\u00a0at one point to check for survivors.\u00a0The dog\u00a0was killed when one of the people in the apartment detonated a suicide vest. Diesel's death sparked a popular hashtag and an outpouring of respect\u00a0and grief on social media. And it highlighted the role specially trained\u00a0dogs play in often dangerous law enforcement situations in France, as well as right here in the United States. It's unclear\u00a0exactly how many police dogs are active in the United States. Jim Watson, director of the North American Police Work Dog Association, gave a \"wild guess\" of around 50,000 dogs in 2010. The dogs\u00a0are deployed to various domestic law enforcement agencies, doing everything from bomb- and drug-sniffing to chasing down suspected criminals. And, unfortunately, police dog work can sometimes be deadly. The Officer Down Memorial Page, which tracks police fatalities in the line of duty,\u00a0includes numbers on police dog fatalities as well. Their numbers show that in 2015 so far, 26 police dogs have been killed in the line of duty \u2014 a number that's up sharply over the previous two years. In the most recent incident they've tracked, a dog named Hyco with the Anderson County Sheriff's Office in South Carolina was shot and killed while chasing a group of suspected carjackers. In September, a police dog named Ike in Washington state was stabbed multiple times while attempting to subdue a suspect and had to be euthanized due to the extent of his injuries. But while a number of dogs have died at the hands of a suspected criminal this year, the ODMP's numbers show that canine officers face an even bigger threat: heat exhaustion, particularly from being left in a squad car on a hot day. This year alone at least 11 dogs died from heat exhaustion, according to the ODMP. In August, two dogs with the Baltimore City Detention Center died when the air conditioning failed in a\u00a0vehicle they were in. In Florida, an officer was suspended without pay in May when he inadvertently left two police dogs in a car at his home. The heat deaths \"happen at a pretty alarming rate,\" said Steve Weiss, an NYPD lieutenant who serves as ODMP's Director of Research. \"I was surprised by how often it happens.\" Weiss says that many K9 unit vehicles are now being outfitted with electronic systems that automatically regulate\u00a0heat and humidity. Some\u00a0systems can alert remote officers\u00a0if the AC fails or the temperature gets too high, and allow them to immediately pop the trunk or doors to allow dogs to escape. More widespread adoption of these systems would cut down on the heat exhaustion deaths, according to Weiss. Weiss says better laws protecting police dogs would help too. \"The laws in many states involving the deaths of police animals are not very strict,\" he said.\u00a0\"Every state is different.\" Update: This piece has been updated to reflect that authorities do not currently believe the woman in the apartment, Hasna Aitboulahcen, detonated the suicide vest.", "3f131ce3978b2b121e160a60bf0289f0": ""}
