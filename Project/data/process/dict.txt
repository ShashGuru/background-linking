02ae7136-006d-11e3-9711-3708310f6f4d: Hillary Rodham Clinton took to a Toronto stage in June before about 5,000 supporters, many of them women and many looking for a hint that she might run for president in 2016 — and she gave them one. “Hypothetically speaking, I really do hope that we have a woman president in my lifetime,” Clinton said coyly, making an implicit nod to the history she might make herself. “Our country,” she added, “has to take that leap of faith.” Unlike during her 2008 presidential campaign, when she waited until her concession speech to fully embrace the historic nature of her candidacy, Clinton these days talks freely about women breaking barriers. She has woven a theme of women’s empowerment throughout almost all of her public remarks in the seven months since she stepped down as secretary of state. Clinton’s advisers said that there is no political agenda behind her recent remarks and that she has made no decision to launch a campaign. They said the comments are simply a natural continuation of her lifelong focus on advocating for women. “If you look at her career from her early days in law school through today, there’s one thing that’s clear, which is this is an in­cred­ibly important issue to her and has been over time,” said Jennifer Klein, a longtime Clinton aide. In her political campaigns, Clinton has always tried to assert her toughness, to prove her mettle — first as the president’s wife seeking a seat in the U.S. Senate and then as a would-be commander in chief in a time of war. In her 2008 campaign, she shunned the “woman” label. Over and over, she said she was running because she thought she was the most qualified candidate and would make the best president. Now, coming off her four-year tour as the nation’s top diplomat and free as a private citizen to pursue her own agenda, she is championing women — making speeches about the unfinished business of the women’s movement and starting an international project focused on women and girls through the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. “It’s not at all surprising that, as she thinks about what she wants to do next, she’s thinking about this issue,” said Klein, who is helping her set up the project. Politically, said Nicolle Wallace, a former GOP strategist who has written two novels about a female Republican president, Clinton’s embrace of women as trailblazers “has the potential to be powerful and successful if it’s authentic — and it has the power to backfire if it seems purely political.” “I have never done a book signing or a book event where women have not come up to me and said something about still being upset about what happened to Hillary — that sense that there was this unsettled experience,” Wallace said. In the 2008 campaign, whether Clinton should make the historic aspect of her candidacy a part of her pitch to voters was a subject of considerable debate among her strategists. Their calculus was complicated by the fact that rival Barack Obama had embraced his role as an African American trailblazer. Ultimately, the advisers decided that doing so might alienate male voters, and they assumed that women would vote for her regardless. But that proved to be a miscalculation. When Clinton finished third in the Iowa caucuses, she lost among women by five percentage points to Obama. “I think that was a big mistake on our part — not wholeheartedly embracing the idea of electing the first woman president of the United States,” said one top Clinton adviser who spoke candidly about the 2008 strategy on the condition of anonymity. Clinton did not talk directly about her historic run until it was over. “Although we weren’t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it’s got about 18 million cracks in it, and the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time,” she said in her concession speech. As Clinton ponders a second run for president, white women — who made up 38 percent of the 2012 electorate — are one demographic group where she could improve upon Obama’s finish. In every presidential election since the advent of national exit polling in 1972, no Democrat has won a majority of white women. Obama fared particularly poorly last year, losing white women to Republican Mitt Romney by 56 percent to 42 percent. The 2016 Democratic primary campaign probably won’t get underway for at least another year, but the epochal nature of Clinton’s potential candidacy is fueling buzz around her. “I think the country is ready for Hillary,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told NBC News last month. Emily’s List, a group that works to elect more women, is barely disguising its support for Clinton. It is staging town hall gatherings in early-voting states — the first was Friday in Iowa, with additional events planned for New Hampshire and Nevada — as part of its “Madam President” campaign. “We hope she runs, and we’re looking forward to standing with her if she decides to do that, but we still live in a country that has never elected a woman to the White House,” Emily’s List President Stephanie Schriock said. “This is not an insignificant moment.” On Monday in San Francisco, the American Bar Association will honor Clinton with the prestigious ABA Medal for her career as a pioneering woman. In 1987, Clinton, then the first lady of Arkansas and the first female partner at the venerable Rose Law Firm, chaired a new ABA commission on women in the legal profession. Aides said she plans to talk about that experience in her acceptance speech. “Go back to a time when women were not a recognized face of the legal profession, and around that time came Hillary Clinton,” ABA President Laurel G. Bellows said. “She is an advocate of the highest order.” In 1995, Clinton made a global splash when, as first lady of the United States, she declared in Beijing, “Human rights are women’s rights, and women’s rights are human rights.” As secretary of state, she made women’s empowerment a core focus. She gave major speeches about the power that women can have in improving government, expanding an economy and securing peace. Clinton devoted her first public remarks after leaving the State Department, an address at the Vital Voices Global Partnership gala, to a discussion of the “untapped potential” of women. And she continued that theme at the Women in the World conference in April. Women, she said, “are agents of change, we are drivers of progress, we are makers of peace — all we need is a fighting chance.” A couple of months later, at a Clinton Global Initiative event in Chicago, she said, “When women participate in politics, the effects ripple out across society.” Conference attendees responded with knowing applause. “She talks about it very passionately now,” said Mo Elleithee, a spokesman with Clinton’s 2008 campaign. “I think she’s aware of that unique role she can play in driving that message and is going to continue to do it.” For the first time in Clinton’s life under the public spotlight, she is unencumbered by other people’s agendas, noted former congresswoman Ellen Tauscher, a Clinton friend and State Department adviser. “In all of those roles, Hillary Clinton supplicated her own personal passions and concerns, the things that she was troubled about — she put them all aside to do things for the people that she was representing,” Tauscher said. “Now this is the first time she actually gets to speak for herself.” In June, Clinton spoke at Bryn Mawr, a historic women’s college in Pennsylvania. She talked about her desire to see more female heads of state. “Bryn Mawr is Welsh for ‘big hill,’ ” Clinton said. “We still have a long way to go and a big hill to climb. If this was easy, it would have already been done. Let’s keep our eye on the goal.”
049739753ce2e539d8dc2165daaf6aa6: “After forty years, we should be further along in having women in senior government positions,” insisted Uschi Schreiber, a global board executive with the professional services organization EY, during our talk at the U.N. Foundation headquarters in Washington, D.C. The reason for her conclusion is unfortunate. Although women account for nearly half of the public sector workforce, they hold only 20 percent of the public sector’s leadership positions, according to EY’s latest “Worldwide Women Public Sector Leaders Index 2014” report. The typical female civil servant will serve the public, feeling good about what she’s doing for her country, but never reach the top rung of the government career ladder. She may feel she deserves a promotion from her “General Schedule” position into a coveted “Senior Executive Service” position. But in reality, it seems there is some combination of cultural expectations, her own preferences and workforce biases that keep her toiling away at her non-executive position. The facts say that she should stop dreaming. Her fate is to stay where she is. Apart from a handful of countries among the 20 that EY examined, women just don’t get promoted to positions of influence in the government. According to Schreiber, this problem differs from the one that arises from the lack of women CEOs in the top Fortune or FTSE 500 companies and on private-sector corporate boards. “Everybody talks about how there aren’t many women on corporate boards and at top levels in the private sector, but the problem is worse when it happens with the government,” Schreiber explained to me when we met in early October. “It looks like a systemic problem.” Government promotions are supposed to be based on merit and thus able to avoid the justifications — women take time off to have children, they don’t ask for promotions, they’re too abrasive — that are typically cited to explain why women are absent in the private sector’s upper echelon. Yet governments are not much better than the private sector in putting women in senior positions. EY’s report counts up the women holding senior, non-politically-appointed positions in the public sector and then ranks the countries according to the share of women in these top leadership positions. The data don’t include elected and politically-appointed officials. (The survey only covers 20 countries and leaves out a number of important nations, including the Scandinavian countries, New Zealand, Chile and Spain. It does include the European Commission, which comes in eighth with its 27.5 percent women’s share. The survey and research was conducted by the international research team at Dods. Senior executives constitute roughly the most senior 10 percent of public officials. The data were chosen, in part, for their comparability across countries.) “Frankly, I’m surprised to see such a low percentage of women in government leadership positions around the world,” she said. Only six countries have one-third or more women in these public sector leadership spots. The rest hover at around 20 percent and below. Canada, where women make up 46 percent of Ottawa’s senior public leadership positions, can take bragging rights. Canada’s long history of implementing programs designed to promote under-represented groups explains this outcome, according to the report. Australia (39 percent), South Africa (38 percent), the United Kingdom (36 percent) and Brazil (34 percent) fill up the next four spots. With no women public sector leaders, Saudi Arabia is at the bottom of the list. Japan comes in second to last – women make up only 1.8 percent of its public sector leaders. Turkey (9 percent), China (9 percent), and South Korea (5 percent) have relatively small shares of women at the top of the public sector, and showed declines in these shares since EY published its inaugural report in 2013. The United States comes in sixth in this competition with 33 percent. Women account for one of every three public sector leaders in the federal government. These leadership positions include the Senior Executive Service in approximately 75 federal agencies, and exclude Cabinet members and top presidential appointees, such as secretaries, assistant secretaries and so forth. The data are from the Office of Personnel Management, which manages the overall federal executive personnel program. As low as it is, 33 percent is much better than the 18 percent of elected officials and 17 percent of private sector board members the EY report identifies. But  33 percent isn’t good enough. There’s no excuse for having just one of every three of the federal government’s public sector leadership positions filled by a woman. If the government won’t voluntarily promote women, perhaps it should consider another way to get women in the upper levels — quotas. “I’m in favor of quotas — that’s my personal view,” said Schreiber, who has held senior positions in government and the private sector. “I’ve been hearing since I was 13 years old that change was coming — I’m over 50 now and it’s time for that change to happen!” “Quotas aren’t the answer everywhere,” she acknowledged, “but some countries need pushing rather than leaving change up to a community’s good will.” Quotas haven’t generally been popular in the United States, often because they stigmatize those who advance by calling them a “token.” But there’s evidence that by putting women in leadership positions, quotas can change people’s attitudes and, in so doing, help eliminate implicit biases against women. India provides some such evidence. In a set of randomly selected villages in India where only women were allowed to run for office, i.e., quotas were imposed, a survey taken after the elections found that people in villages with quotas were much more likely to see women as competent leaders than those from villages that didn’t have quotas. Before the quota, voters had never had the chance to evaluate a woman’s performance. After the quota, voters had a basis on which to judge, and they judged women leaders favorably. Businesses also seem to be considering quotas as a way to break the barrier to getting women in senior positions. A survey by Grant Thornton found that business support for quotas to increase the number of women on corporate boards rose to 45 percent from 37 percent a year ago. According to Schreiber, leadership teams need to make themselves uncomfortable to bring about change. “Quotas help bring about that change and get around the unconscious bias that many women face. People like to be surrounded by people they’re comfortable with and, if those people have always been men, then they’re going to be comfortable with men around them.” She concluded our conversation by saying: “We don’t have to live with unconscious bias. We can create a leadership team that is willing to address gender equity. We can promote women.”
09b3167f0d1aa5cfa8be932bb704d75a: On Jan. 3, 2013, the Senate broke two records. That day, 20 women raised their right hands to take the oath of office, forming the largest group of women senators in history. It was also the first time that five women were simultaneously elected to the upper chamber. That achievement has been hailed as a high watermark for women’s achievement in Washington. But so far, it has also proved impossible to repeat. Though more and more women have appeared on ballots over the past three years, it is still unlikely that the 2017 Senate class will have as many new female faces. This year, for instance, nine women are running for Senate — but with two months to go before Election Day, only two are comfortably within range of winning.  The dearth of women holding federal office is not for lack of effort from those who want them to run. Democrats and Republicans are engaged in an aggressive and conscious campaign to recruit more women — and once they’ve convinced a promising woman to run, to ensure that she has the resources necessary to win. But their results have been decidedly mixed. “Women often don’t think of elected office as the first step of public service,” said Stephanie Schriock, president of Emily’s List, an organization dedicated to electing pro-abortion rights Democratic women. “They often think that, ‘Well, I’m going to work on the PTA,’ or ‘I’m going to work on the environmental organization I care about.’” Emily’s List reports that it takes an average of seven asks to get a woman to agree to run for any office. Schriock said finding women receptive to running for the Senate — the highest statewide elected position in the federal government — is even more challenging. “If you’re talking about a class of women running for Senate, it is rare to have that many women who are ready to jump into those races,” Schriock said, adding many prospective female candidates don’t see politics as the road to change. Both Republicans and Democrats have encountered similar roadblocks in getting women to seriously contemplate running for federal office, including worries about fundraising, exposing their families to negative publicity and the burdens of often trying to maintain two homes — one in Washington and one in their home states. “The thing I was probably most curious about was how it works to have lives in two different places,” Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who was elected in the record year of 2012, said in an interview. “My husband still lives in North Dakota.” The recruiting problem is most daunting for Republicans — there are currently six Republican women in the Senate compared with 14 Democratic women. There is one new female Republican nominee in a competitive Senate race this year, compared with nine Democratic women. Republican strategists acknowledge that their presidential nominee, Donald Trump, is unlikely to help their efforts, given his many disparaging comments about women. GOP strategist Katie Packer, who worked on Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign, said the problem has been compounded by women who say they don’t want their personal lives dragged into politics. “I think there tends to be a little bit of cynicism about politics and they are just more interested in serving in some other way,” Packer said. The dilemma for Republicans starts with their messaging to and about women, which seems to be widening the gender gap — Trump trails rival Hillary Clinton among women by double digits in the latest polls. GOP men are often seen as enemies of reproductive rights, and comments about rape by former Republican Senate candidates Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock — who both lost — have not helped. A 2015 survey by Pew Charitable Trusts found that 52 percent of women either strongly identify or lean Democratic compared with 36 percent for Republicans. “There are a lot of women who are disgusted by politics, so they don’t really want to get into the game,” Packer said. Persuading women to run has become a year-round obsession for strategists. One major challenge is finding women at the building-block level of the recruiting tree: state and local elections. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, (D-Wis.) — the first openly gay women in that chamber — recalled her first race for public office: a seat on the Dane County Board of Supervisors when she was 24 years old. She was already participating in a number of political organizations and activist groups, and wanted to seek public office. But it still took active encouragement and mentorship to keep her in the race. “I don’t know that I would have had the courage if there weren’t an openly gay man and a woman on the Dane County board already” Baldwin said in an interview. “They had to say, ‘Yes, you’re talented. Yes, you ought to be on the board.'” Nearly every woman interviewed described challenges in breaking into local political networking circles, saying such events are typically organized by men and held in male-dominated spaces, such as sporting events, cigar clubs and poker nights. “They don’t do that to keep women out, but most of the people in the circle are men. As a woman, you can either pretend you enjoy that stuff or you’re kept out of it,” Packer said. One difference between male and female candidates, several strategists and lawmakers said, is that women need to be asked, and several times, to step up to the plate. “Women just want to be asked,” Schriock said. “They don’t just want to assume they can do it. They want to know that they have other people’s confidence in their abilities. Recruitment relies on a network of scouts that includes elected officials, major donors and women’s groups such as Emily’s List and the conservative Susan B. Anthony List. But Republican groups are far less organized and focused than their counterparts on the left. “There really isn’t one group out there solely committed to electing conservative women,” Packer said. Finding women to run is hard enough — but finding a diverse group of women is even more difficult. The closest the Senate has come to the 2012 wave of newly elected women was during the year of the woman in 1992 when Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) Carol Moseley Braun (D-Ill.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) were elected. That year they joined Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) to create a celebrated power team of women who have been deeply connected ever since. Three of the four are still in Congress and have spent their careers establishing themselves as the most powerful women at the top of some of the most influential committees. Murray, who campaigned as the “mom in tennis shoes” during race in 1992, is the only woman in the top ranks of Senate leadership. Feinstein is the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Boxer is the leading Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee. Both Boxer and Mikulski are retiring this year — in Boxer’s case, it’s a certainty a woman will replace her, but in Maryland, Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D) beat Rep. Donna F. Edwards (D) in the primary, despite massive help for Edwards from Emily’s List. Murray was also the architect of the push to make sure women dominated the 2013 Senate class as the chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “I would say if I hadn’t been DSCC chair, many of [the women who were elected] would have been told, ‘You can’t do this,’” Murray said during an interview in June. “I felt very strongly my job was for them to hear that they can do it, that there will be help and support for them and this is a great opportunity.” Murray said she was lucky in that most of the female candidates that year initiated their campaigns rather than needing to be persuaded. All four Democrats — Baldwin, Heitkamp, Masie Hirono (Hawaii) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — had been primed for their campaigns for years. Hirono, Baldwin and Heitkamp had all run for statewide office in the past, and Warren was a national figure who led the panel that oversaw the Troubled Asset Relief Program in the wake of the Great Recession. “Interestingly in that year, many of them came to us,” Murray said. “There were really strong women willing to run.” But even then, the female candidates had a lot of questions. Primarily, they asked how they would raise enough money to be competitive, how they would master a wide variety of national issues and what would happen to their families in a campaign. Heitkamp was the kind of candidate Senate Democrats had been chasing for years. She had already run for statewide office several times before bidding for the Senate. She won a race for state attorney general, lost her 2000 gubernatorial bid and battled breast cancer. By the time she ran for Senate, Heitkamp was convinced that she couldn’t be beat up any more. “It is tougher for women to get elected to executive positions,” Heitkamp said. Like Heitkamp, Hirono ran for governor and lost. By the time the Senate seat opened up, she decided she wanted to run but was worried about raising the money it takes to win. “You have to be a risk-taker,” Hirono said. “The decision to run for Senate was daunting.”
041e530b21766fc294d4e9c48b1e2723: Unnur Bra Konradsdottir was faced with a dilemma. The Icelandic lawmaker was sitting in parliament Wednesday, breast-feeding her 6-week-old daughter, when she was unexpectedly called to respond to a bill. Konradsdottir, who has been an MP — a member of the Althing, the country’s parliament — since 2009, walked up to the lectern with her baby still at her breast. In full view of her fellow lawmakers and television cameras, she delivered her remarks with her daughter nursing quietly. “It’s like any job: You’ve got to do what you’ve got to do,” Konradsdottir later told Agence France-Presse. “It is the most natural thing in the world.” If she was nervous, it didn’t show in videos of the session. And if any of her fellow lawmakers were surprised, that didn’t show either. After Konradsdottir finished speaking, a passionate debate continued — about the immigration law that the lawmakers had been discussing. The breast-feeding itself was a nonissue, the 42-year-old member of the country’s Independence Party said. “She was hungry and I had not expected to go to the pulpit,” Konradsdottir said, according to the Independent. “Then another MP was giving statements on a bill that I put forward on the behalf of the Judicial Affairs Committee, to which I had to respond. So I either had to tear the baby girl off me and leave her crying with the MP sitting next to me or just take her with me, and I thought it would cause less disturbance to take her with me.” The baby is Konradsdottir’s third child and was born Sept. 1, according to the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service. Konradsdottir said her fellow lawmakers were used to her baby anyway because she has been with her at the parliament “almost since she was born,” the Independent reported. “She has attended numerous committee meetings with me over the final days of this parliament,” Konradsdottir said, according to the paper. “Usually she is very calm and when we cast our votes she is sound asleep. So there have never been any incidents before.” According to Icelandic media outlets, it is believed to be the first time anyone in the country has breast-fed while giving a parliamentary speech. But the fact that no one batted an eyelash is not surprising: Iceland has long had a liberal, relaxed view of breast-feeding in public. How relaxed? Last March, Icelandic MP Bjort Olafsdottir, one of Konradsdottir’s colleagues, posted a picture of her breast on Twitter in support of the #FreeTheNipple campaign — a movement that argues that women are unequally punished for toplessness. “This is for feeding babies,” Olafsdottir tweeted, according to an English translation in Iceland Magazine. “Shove that up your patriarchy.” The attitudes correlate with the country’s progressive parental leave policies. Iceland is often ranked among the world’s best countries for new mothers and is also among the most generous countries when it comes to paternity leave, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2000, Iceland extended its parental leave to nine months, allotting three months to new mothers and three to new fathers, with the remaining three months divided between the parents as they chose. The federal policy covers parents who have been employed for six months or longer in Iceland and includes the birth, adoption or permanent fostering of a child. By contrast, the United States does not guarantee paid leave for new mothers — one of the only highly competitive countries in the world not to do so, according to the same Pew Research Center report. Some of the other countries that also do not provide paid medical leave are Suriname, Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Palau and Tonga, The Washington Post has reported. Whether directly or indirectly related, stories regularly surface in the United States of women who have been shamed or assailed for breast-feeding in public. Earlier this year, a judge in North Carolina told Stephanie Rhodus, a woman breast-feeding her 8-month-old son during a court appearance, to cover up or leave his courtroom, The Post reported. “Ma’am, you need to cover up,” the judge can be heard saying in a recording of the incident. “For you not to realize that is absolutely ridiculous. Step outside, and cover up right now. Stand up, and go, now.” “He was so condescending and so aggressive,” Rhodus told ABC News. “And I knew that by law I had the right to breast-feed my child there, and I wanted to declare that I had the right to do that there, but I was terrified.” In June, several good Samaritans rushed to the defense of a Connecticut mother who was verbally accosted by a man for breast-feeding in the cafe section of a Target store. The mother, Jessie Maher, filmed the encounter and posted it to Facebook after he called her “f---ing disgusting” and “nasty.” Shaking, Maher can be heard crying in the video as a woman comforts her and then shouts angrily back at the man. Eventually, several Target employees appear to escort the man toward the door. “Don’t shake, you’re fine. He has no right to be doing what he’s doing — you have a baby in your hands,” the woman told Maher, adding: “This is a beautiful moment right now. If he doesn't like it, he can go.” Dip a toe into any online parenting forum and you may find no more fervent debate than the one that surrounds breast-feeding. The World Health Organization recommends breast-feeding exclusively until a child is 6 months old, continuing as appropriate. For some women, though, breast-feeding is uncomfortable and even painful, or otherwise not possible. “We all know not to throw baby out with the bath water — but let’s not throw mother out for her milk either,” a trio of doctors wrote in a recent guest column for The Post. “Here’s our prescription: If breast-feeding works for you, great. If it doesn’t, don’t tie yourself in knots to make it happen.” However, groups like La Leche League International and Normalize Breastfeeding say they are seeking to encourage those women who do choose to breast-feed by fighting the stigma that surrounds the act. “Day after day, mothers around the United States are being removed from restaurants, asked to leave boutiques, and are often told to go to the restroom to breastfeed their babies,” reads a statement on Normalize Breastfeeding’s website. “It’s time to change that.” They may have a new champion in Iceland.

00f57310e5c8ec7833d6756ba637332e:   A record-breaking number of women were elected to the British Parliament in Thursday’s election, with many calling it a “historic” moment. When legislators return to Westminster next week, there will be 208 women among their ranks, or 32 percent of Parliament. The majority of the parties are also led by women. In fact, Prime Minister Theresa May is now negotiating with another woman, Arlene Foster of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, to form a government. But is this election really a turning point for women in the United Kingdom? Despite the headlines, these results represent only an incremental change — a gain of just 12 more seats for women. And although women might be better represented in Parliament than in the U.S. Congress, the United Kingdom still lags behind most European and Latin American democracies. Thursday’s election moved it from 46 to 39 in the global rankings. Focusing on the headline number also obscures significant variation across parties and regions. The parties aren’t alike As with the Democrats in the United States, women’s representation is highest in the center-left Labour Party. Women hold 45 percent of Labour seats (119 of 262) compared with 21 percent of Conservative seats. In fact, the number of women parliamentarians in the Conservative Party actually decreased from 70 to 67 in this election. The difference between the parties is because of a strategy — “all-women shortlists” — adopted by the Labour Party in 1994. Labour requires that half of all winnable seats be contested by female candidates. When it was partially implemented for the first time in 1997, women’s numbers grew from 37 to 101. Since being fully implemented from 2005 onwards, women’s representation has never fallen below 27 percent. Scotland is different, too There is also variation within the U.K. itself. Women’s representation actually decreased in Scotland. This is in large part because of the Conservative gains in the region: among the thirteen returning members of Parliament, only one is a woman. And this is despite the striking prominence of women in Scottish politics, where the leaders of the three major parties are all women, and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon appointed a gender-balanced Cabinet. The U.K. isn’t close to gender parity The U.K. remains a long way from gender parity in Parliament. To get there, the Conservatives will have to increase the number of female candidates competing in winnable seats. They’ve tried to bolster women’s numbers before through “soft” measures — such as the Women2Win initiative co-founded by Theresa May to support and train Conservative women, and the gender balanced “priority list” of prospective candidates that local parties were encouraged to select from (although it proved unpopular and was soon abandoned). Despite acknowledging the need for more women in politics, the Conservative Party remains opposed to a strategy like all-women shortlists. Their resistance is not surprising. While there are right-leaning parties in Western Europe with voluntary quotas (including the German Christian Democrats and Austrian People’s Party), no conservative party in the region has been willing to implement this strategy. Moreover, Britain, unlike more than 75 countries across the globe, has not adopted legislation that mandates the selection or election of female candidates for office. A growing number of European countries have done so, including France in 1999, Ireland in 2012 and Poland in 2011. What comes next?  One crucial issue on the agenda: women’s reproductive rights. The governing coalition will likely include the Conservative Party and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, and the DUP has consistently campaigned to limit abortion rights. The DUP’s former health minister, Jim Wells, has even argued against abortion in cases of rape. Newly elected MP Owen Paterson confirmed in an interview yesterday that abortion restrictions might be up for debate. At the same time, May’s position is precarious, and many observers do not expect this fragile coalition to last long. If new elections are on the horizon, then we will soon see whether there will be further increases in women’s representation — and if so, what that means for public policy.
